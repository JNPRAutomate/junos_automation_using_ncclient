# About NETCONF

NETCONF is a protocol defined in the [RFC 6241](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6241)   

Junos has a NETCONF server  
ncclient is a NETCONF client  

The file [NETCONF_session.md](NETCONF_session.md) shows how to use NETCONF in an SSH connection.  

# About Jupyter notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contains live code.

# About this repo 

This repo has several Jupyter notebook files (ipynb file extension). These files have Junos automation content using ncclient  

This repo also shows how to use NETCONF inside an SSH connection (file [NETCONF_session.md](NETCONF_session.md))

# Instructions 

Install Docker 

Pull the Docker image for Jupyter
```
$ docker pull jupyter/minimal-notebook
```
```
$ docker images jupyter/minimal-notebook
REPOSITORY                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
jupyter/minimal-notebook   latest              5741bc0030bd        2 weeks ago         2.57GB
```
Instanciate a container 
```
$ docker run --rm --name ncclient -d -p 9081:8888 -v $PWD:/home/jovyan/ jupyter/minimal-notebook
```
```
$ docker ps | grep jupyter/minimal-notebook
c57eac4264a9        jupyter/minimal-notebook   "tini -g -- start-noâ€¦"   10 minutes ago      Up 10 minutes       0.0.0.0:9081->8888/tcp                            ncclient
```
Install the requirements on the container 
```
$ docker exec ncclient pip install ncclient
```
```
$ docker exec ncclient pip list | grep ncclient
ncclient               0.6.6
```
Open a browser.  
The URL is `http://IP:PORT/?token=xxxxxxxx`   
- The default port is 8888 but the container instanciated with the above `docker run` command use the port 9081  
- The token is provided with the command `$ docker exec ncclient jupyter notebook list`

Then you can use Jupyter files. They have ncclient content to automate Junos. You also need a Junos device.    

# Stop Jupyter 

```
$ docker stop ncclient
ncclient
$ docker ps | grep ncclient
$ docker ps -a | grep ncclient
$ 
```
The changes on the .ipynb files are automatically saved locally.  
```
$ ls -l
```
